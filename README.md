## Description ðŸ““

Thanks for visiting my GitHub, you can access the Image App [here](https://github.com/CaeRoberts/ImageApp). The project is divided into 3 sections. 

Section  | Description
------------- | -------------
Search Bar  | An easy to use Search Bar that setsState based on search query and returns it to the Unsplash API. Passes information through props for access by the Image List.
Image List  | Takes information derived from the Search Bar (through the APP) and displays images in individual grid cards styled by Semantic UI. Passes information to a sub-component imageCard. 
Saved Images Section  | Displays images that have been "hearted" in the same format as Image List. Uses localStorage to retain image keys & URL.
